Our industry consultation outlines the demand for illustrative design as well as a more User Experience/ User Interface approach. We integrate live briefs with real clients. An example of the high standard of work our students produce is our involvement with the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD) where our students have won international awards and our participation in Award School. All students become members of the Australian Graphic Design Association (AGDA), the industry’s leading body. We also host the annual AGDA folio review where feedback is received from industry members in how to best structure your portfolio. In addition to this we conduct industry visits and host guest speakers who shed light on the latest trends in our industry. This course is demanding, but the rewards and satisfaction are great.
